**Privacy Policy**

Roman Cinis built the Colors AI app as an Free and Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by Roman Cinis at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

This application does not collect or transmit any user’s personal information, with the exception of technical information included in HTTP requests (such as your IP address). No personal information is used, stored, secured or disclosed by services this application works with. If you would like to report any violations of this policy, please contact contact me at colors.ai.app@gmail.com.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Colors AI unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

**Information Collection and Use**

For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.

**Personal information**

This application does not collect or transmit any user's personally identifiable information. No personal information is used, stored, secured or disclosed by services this application works with.

**Technical information**

Limited technical information is sent (such as IP addresses included in the HTTP calls the application makes) but none of that is used or stored.

**Links to Other Sites**

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

**Children’s Privacy**

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.

**Third parties**

If the app makes use of third party services, their usage of information is excluded from this privacy policy. You will be clearly made aware of the third parties involved in the app and we will ensure the very minimal set of data is set to those third parties.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2021-09-17
