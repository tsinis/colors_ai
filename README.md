## Description

Colors AI is a gesture-first color scheme generator that uses **deep learning from Colormind API**. Application is made with Flutter and available for Android devices.

## Technical Data

![Architecture](https://uploads.toptal.io/blog/image/127604/toptal-blog-image-1543392877448-c9419df15f27b73c01c86e21cc7c5c9c.png)
App is made with a reactive style **BLoC pattern**, in four-layered architecture. User **events are passed to Blocs**, which are **processing inputs to repositories and waiting** (async mostly, since we are fetching, parsing data from REST API) **for their response from the data layer**. After that **Blocs mapping the states according to repository response**. Data layers are not linked to Flutter itself, they are abstracted from the framework and using pure Dart dependencies only. Also, no dependency injectors are used in this app either.

Application is **partially covered with Unit, Widget, and Integration tests**. More to come in the future.

All Dart code is linted with [Pedantic](https://pub.dev/packages/pedantic). Hive with custom Color TypeAdapter is used here for local data storage. HTTP package is used for network requests to Colormind API.

**Application is null-safety ready**, there is only one dependency missing to be fully "sound" null safe ATM.

### How to run it

Flutter version **1.23** or higher is assumed to be installed. Please run this command from the project's folder, in your terminal:

```bash
flutter run --no-sound-null-safety
```

## UI/UX Design

All animations here are made with pure Flutter. The application's UI is designed with "gesture-first" UX and strictly following [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/design). Neutral grey color UI is used here to not disrupt user's color perception with highly contrasting light or dark themes.

## To-Do Section

* [ ] Write more tests.
* [ ] Separate data layer more.
* [ ] Create more interfaces for Data and Repository layers.
* [ ] Add dependencies list in README.
* [ ] Add exports to PDF and JPG.
* [ ] L10N.
