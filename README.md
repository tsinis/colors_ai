## Description

Colors AI is a multiplatform color scheme generator that uses **deep learning from Colormind API**. Application is made with Flutter and available for Android, Windows, Linux, macOS and iOS platforms.

## Technical Data

### Architecture

![Architecture](https://uploads.toptal.io/blog/image/127604/toptal-blog-image-1543392877448-c9419df15f27b73c01c86e21cc7c5c9c.png)
App is made with a reactive style **BLoC pattern**, in four-layered architecture. User **events are passed to Blocs**, which are **processing inputs to repositories and waiting** (async mostly, since we are fetching, parsing data from REST API) **for their response from the data layer**. After that **Blocs mapping the states according to repository response**. Data layers are not linked to Flutter itself, they are abstracted from the framework and using pure Dart dependencies only. Also, no dependency injectors are used in this app either.

### Directory Structure

The application uses a **feature-driven** directory structure. This project structure allows to scale the project by having self-contained features.

### Tests

Application is **partially covered with Unit, Widget, and Integration tests**. More to come in the future.

### How to run it

Flutter version **2.6.0** or higher is assumed to be installed. Please run this command from the project's folder, in your terminal:

```bash
flutter run
```

## UI/UX Design

All animations here are made with pure Flutter. The application's UI is designed with "gesture-first" UX on mobile platforms and strictly following [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/design). Neutral grey color UI is used here to not disrupt user's color perception with highly contrasting light or dark themes.

## To-Do Section

* [ ] Write more tests.
* [x] Separate data layer more.
* [x] Create more interfaces for Data and Repository layers.
* [x] Add exports to PDF and PNG.
* [x] L10N.
* [ ] Add Feedback.
* [ ] Map BLoC events to state via Freezed.
* [ ] Provide support for Favorites backup (online?).
